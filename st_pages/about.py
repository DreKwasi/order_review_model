        st.markdown("""
        The Order Review Project monitors compares the month-on-month dispensation of Retail Facilities with 
        their respective monthly demand.

        Given the difficulty in attaining appreciable fulfillment levels within a give timeframe,
        the Order Review Model provides a unique approach fulfilling 'rational' demand across the various facilities.

        The Order Review Model ascertain a facilities demand as a function of their Stock Balance, Product Category,
        Facility & Regional Dispensation of Product and finally Withdrawal Patterns (Facility/Warehouse Initiated)
        
        In future models, a forecast model will be trained using the factors mentioned above to ascertain consistent
        and progressive demand thus reducing the JIT model of procurement to a more sustainable approach.
